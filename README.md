My work towards [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

Found out about it in late 2021 prior to that round, so just started with working through 2020. Fun stuff!!

# epilogue

Whoa. This was tough! I managed to finish the last puzzle on Dec 29th. Day 19 and upward were all doozies in my opinion, each one taking a long time.

I won't say this is the best code i've ever written, but it was all a fantastic experience and it definitely made me a crap ton more proficient in Javascript / Typescript. Particularily, i will never make the following mistake again:

If `someVal` might possibly be 0 as a legit response from a function:

```
if(!someVal) {
  ...
}
```

Never, ever do the above ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
